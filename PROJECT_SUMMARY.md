# Transcriptor de Video/Audio - Project Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive audio/video transcription application with the following key features:

1. **Robust Audio Preprocessing Pipeline**
   - FFmpeg integration for extracting audio from any video/audio container
   - Conversion to 16kHz mono PCM for optimal model input
   - EBU R128 loudness normalization for consistent energy levels
   - Optional RNNoise noise suppression for improved quality

2. **Advanced Voice Activity Detection**
   - Silero VAD implementation for accurate speech detection
   - Segmentation with hysteresis to avoid mid-word cuts
   - Configurable parameters for different audio conditions

3. **High-Fidelity Transcription**
   - faster-whisper (CTranslate2) for significantly faster inference
   - Support for all Whisper model sizes (tiny to large-v3)
   - CUDA/CPU acceleration with quantization support

4. **Precise Word-Level Alignment**
   - WhisperX integration for stable per-word timestamps
   - Essential for professional subtitles and synchronization

5. **Optional Speaker Diarization**
   - pyannote.audio for "who spoke when" detection
   - Hugging Face token support for latest models
   - Speaker-colored segments in the editor

6. **Modern PyQt6 UI**
   - Fluent/WinUI design principles with light/dark themes
   - Three-panel layout: Project Area, Process Panel, Transcription Editor
   - Guided tours and contextual help system
   - WYSIWYG transcription editor with speaker identification

7. **Robust Streaming Pipeline**
   - Fault-tolerant processing with state persistence
   - Memory-mapped audio reading for large files
   - GPU/CPU load balancing with back-pressure queues

8. **Windows Compatibility**
   - ONNX Runtime with DirectML backend for non-NVIDIA hardware
   - PyInstaller packaging for portable Windows executables
   - Inno Setup installer for professional installation

9. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - pytest-based test suite with 27 test cases
   - UI testing with pytest-qt
   - Performance benchmarking with JiWER metrics

10. **CI/CD Automation**
    - GitHub Actions workflow for testing and building
    - Automated releases with binary artifacts
    - Cross-platform compatibility testing
